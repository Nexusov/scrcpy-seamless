# Changes from scrcpy 4.0

## Selective upstream correctness ports during Phase 2

The client retains its scrcpy 4.0 protocol and imported 1.x server/runtime.
The [early upstream audit](upstream/PORTS.md) tracks individual v4.1 fixes.
The initial-window size now crosses from the decoder thread to the SDL main
thread through an owned event payload, adapted from upstream #6911. The native
demuxer rejects zero-size session metadata, and pending payloads are released
after event producers stop during normal teardown or Seamless reconnect.
These changes do not implement the planned 2.0 lifecycle architecture.

Reconnection is enabled by the `SCRCPY_RECONNECT_SERIAL` environment variable,
which contains the ADB Wi-Fi device name of a previously paired phone.

## Implementation

Paths below are relative to `src/scrcpy/`.

- `app/src/scrcpy.c`: adds the reconnection loop and session cleanup while retaining
  the window; handles window closure while waiting for a connection.
- `app/src/screen.c` and `app/src/screen.h`: preserve the window, texture, and last
  frame; rebind device controls; block input until the first new frame; update the
  aspect ratio and restore mouse capture.
- `app/src/events.c` and `app/src/events.h`: resume processing main-thread tasks
  after the previous event producers have stopped.
- `app/src/server.c`: resolve the persistent mDNS name through ADB again before
  connecting over Wi-Fi.

## Validation

The following native baseline checks were completed before the launcher refactor:

- Windows x64 client build.
- Recovery after forcibly terminating the server for a test session.
- Preservation of the process ID and SDL window handle (HWND) across reconnection.
- Repeated reconnection.
- Window closure while the device address is unavailable.
- Launch without a console window.

Recovery after physically disconnecting USB was also manually confirmed on a POCO
phone running Android 16. Detailed local logs and device identifiers are excluded
from Git.

## First-run setup wizard

- `Settings.vbs` opens `launcher/setup.ps1`, which composes the settings session,
  runtime adapter, and Windows Forms view. Older `setup.vbs` entry points remain compatible.
- `launcher/launcher-core.ps1` handles service discovery, device identity, and pairing.
  Shared `adb-process.ps1` and `configuration-store.ps1` own process execution and
  persistence. Pairing codes are not saved.
- `launcher/launch.ps1` composes the connection controller and waiting window;
  `connection-core.ps1` preserves USB priority and selected connection mode.
- `scripts/package.ps1`: includes the wizard and shared helpers in portable ZIPs.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for current module boundaries, cancellation,
Retry generations, saved-state conflicts, and reset behavior.

Automated checks cover authorized/unauthorized devices, emulator/network device
exclusion, incorrect pairing, wrong-device discovery and identity, manual fallback,
legacy launch, USB priority, Wi-Fi launch, USB-only mode, cancellation, and ADB
process timeouts. Run them on Windows PowerShell 5.1:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\test.ps1
```

These tests use disposable fake ADB/client executables. They do not replace a
physical USB-disconnection test on an Android phone. The native reconnection
client and its runtime DLLs are unchanged by the wizard update.

## Wi-Fi-only onboarding

The setup wizard can now pair without a USB device. It reads the phone serial
through the paired Wi-Fi connection and retains USB priority for future launches.
Automatic pairing requires an unambiguous advertisement; manual pairing and
connection endpoints must share the phone IP and use different ports. Regression
tests cover Wi-Fi-only discovery, manual setup, configuration persistence,
ambiguous advertisements, and accidental reuse of the pairing port.

## Connection modes and simpler startup

- Setup offers USB, Wi-Fi, and USB + Wi-Fi (recommended) as separate modes.
- USB mode hides pairing controls; Wi-Fi mode does not require a USB phone.
  Combined mode verifies both connections and keeps automatic fallback.
- Manual address fields are collapsed until requested.
- `ConnectionMode` is saved in `phone.json` and respected on every launch.
  Legacy settings infer automatic fallback when Wi-Fi was configured, or USB
  otherwise. Existing settings do not need to be edited or recreated.
- `Start.vbs` is the user-facing entry point. `launch.vbs` remains compatible
  with existing shortcuts; neither file installs the application.
